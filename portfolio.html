          <p>Skoll is a product for aspiring parents, Who want their kids to get admission in standard schools in and around their city. Over a span of two months I have built this product from scratch i.e.,front to back single handedly by myself.</p>
          <p>Skool initially authenticates user with their registered username and password and allows them to search for the schools with criteria. The user can apply to schools from one click of the button by filling the form. Once the application is completed the application gets saved in mlabs remote server.
           School with admin key can access the applications and shortlist them based on their criteria. The admin functionality is also added into the application.

          <p>Inkoop is a startup company they work with ruby on rails and few other technologies. They had a website for their company and I helped them to redesign their site.</p>
          <p>Their requirement was to have a website which showcases their vision and portfolio. I worked as a freelance front-end developer with inkoop to redesign their website and bring some design sense.I also worked with them to
            change their static single page site which was non resposnive to responsive. I used Jekyll to build their site. My Job with inkoop was to redesign their site and provide them design ideas with their company site and with their client projects.</p>
